abstract = {We study the possibility that the mutual interactions between Jupiter and Saturn prevented Type II migration from driving these planets much closer to the Sun. Our work extends previous results by Masset and Snellgrove [Masset, F., Snellgrove, M., 2001. Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 320, L55–L59], by exploring a wider set of initial conditions and disk parameters, and by using a new hydrodynamical code that properly describes for the global viscous evolution of the disk. Initially both planets migrate towards the Sun, and Saturn's migration tends to be faster. As a consequence, they eventually end up locked in a mean motion resonance. If this happens in the 2:3 resonance, the resonant motion is particularly stable, and the gaps opened by the planets in the disk may overlap. This causes a drastic change in the torque balance for the two planets, which substantially slows down the planets' inward migration. If the gap overlap is substantial, planet migration may even be stopped or reversed. As the widths of the gaps depend on disk viscosity and scale height, this mechanism is particularly efficient in low viscosity, cool disks. The initial locking of the planets in the 2:3 resonance is a likely outcome if Saturn formed at the edge of Jupiter's gap, but also if Saturn initially migrated rapidly from further away. We also explore the possibility of trapping in other resonances, and the subsequent evolutions. We discuss the compatibility of our results with the initial conditions adopted in Tsiganis et al.

abstract = {We present analytic and numerical results which illustrate the effects of Jupiter's accretion of nebular gas and the planet's radial migration on its Trojan companions. Initially, we approximate the system by the planar circular restricted three-body problem and assume small Trojan libration amplitudes. Employing an adiabatic invariant calculation, we show that Jupiter's 30-fold growth from a 10 M⊕ core to its present mass causes the libration amplitudes of Trojan asteroids to shrink by a factor of about 2.5 to ∼40% of their original size. The calculation also shows that Jupiter's radial migration has comparatively little effect on the Trojans; inward migration from 6.2 to 5.2 AU causes an increase in Trojan libration amplitudes of ∼4%. In each case, the area enclosed by small tadpole orbits, if made dimensionless by using Jupiter's semimajor axis, is approximately conserved. Similar adiabatic invariant calculations for inclined and eccentric Trojans show that Jupiter's mass growth leaves the asteroids' eccentricities and inclinations essentially unchanged, while 1 AU of inward migration causes an increase in both of these quantities by ∼4%. Numerical integrations confirm and extend these analytic results. We demonstrate that our predictions remain valid for Trojans with small libration amplitudes even when the asteroids have low, but nonzero, eccentricities and inclinations and/or Jupiter has an eccentricity similar to its present value. The integrations also show that Trojans with large libration amplitudes, including horseshoe orbits, are even more strongly affected by Jupiter's mass growth and radial migration than simple scaling from our analytic results would suggest. Further, the numerical runs demonstrate that Jupiter's predicted mass growth is sufficient to cause the capture of asteroids initially on horseshoe orbits into stable tadpole orbits. Thus, if Jupiter captured most of its Trojan companions before or while it accreted gas, as seems probable, then Jupiter's growth played a significant role in stabilizing Trojan objects by systematically driving them to lower libration amplitudes.}

	abstract = {Pebble accretion is an efﬁcient mechanism that is able to build up the core of the giant planets within the lifetime of the protoplanetary disc gas-phase. The core grows via this process until the protoplanet reaches its pebble isolation mass and starts to accrete gas. During the growth, the protoplanet undergoes a rapid, large-scale, inward migration due to the interactions with the gaseous protoplanetary disc. In this work, we have investigated how this early migration would have affected the minor body populations in our solar system. In particular, we focus on the Jupiter Trojan asteroids (bodies in the coorbital resonance 1:1 with Jupiter, librating around the L4 and L5 Lagrangian points called, respectively, the leading and the trailing swarm) and the Hilda asteroids. We characterised their orbital parameter distributions after the disc dispersal and their formation location and compare them to the same populations produced in a classical in situ growth model. We ﬁnd that a massive and eccentric Hilda group is captured during the migration from a region between 5 and 8 au and subsequently depleted during the late instability of the giant planets. Our simulations also show that inward migration of the giant planets always produces a Jupiter Trojans’ leading swarm more populated than the trailing one, with a ratio comparable to the current observed Trojan asymmetry ratio. The in situ formation of Jupiter, on the other hand, produces symmetric swarms. The reason for the asymmetry is the relative drift between the migrating planet and the particles in the coorbital resonance. The capture happens during the growth of Jupiter’s core and Trojan asteroids are afterwards carried along during the giant planet’s migration to their ﬁnal orbits. The asymmetry and eccentricity of the captured Trojans correspond well to observations, but their inclinations are near zero and their total mass is three to four orders of magnitude higher than the current population. Future modelling will be needed to understand whether the dynamical evolution of the Trojans over billions of years will raise the inclinations and deplete the masses to observed values.},
